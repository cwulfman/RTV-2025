# Rock The Vote Registration Form Tri-Fold Mailer

This repository contains PDF form templates, test data, and
data dictionaries for each of the three pages of the RTV registration document.


## page_1
Page 1 is formatted page of instructions, which must be localized for different languages. The PDF template defines twenty-five text fields; the data file contains sample values in three languages: Spanish, Tagalog, and English.  The data-dictionary file describes the fields and their values.
  
## page_2
Page 2 is a proper form with fields meant to be filled with user data collected in the Rocky tool.  The text in this page is hard-coded, unlike that in page_1.

## page_3
A simple page with fields for a mailing address.
